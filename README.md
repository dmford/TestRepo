#Frustration of Software Developers
We are researches conducting a survey on frustration of software developers.

We previously studied other factors of software developers (e.g., [Programmer, Interrupted](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/)). Your answers will help researchers gather data about frustration and investigate possible detection and alleviation mechanisms.
